# TripAdvisor-Replica
I designed a Trip Advisor app replica in Figma, including splash, sign in/sign up, home, search, trips, reviews, and account pages. The project strengthened my UI/UX design skills, focusing on clean layouts, smooth navigation flow, and consistent user experience. It also gave me hands-on practice in mobile app prototyping and user-centered design.
